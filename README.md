============

Remind me that is a python application that forwards emails from my local inbox (on a new gmail account I made) to the private email box on remember the milk.

This gives me a global email address I can give out to people such that they can add things to my //todo list and a way to filter those approved senders.

Future features possibly include an automated responder for... just about anything.
